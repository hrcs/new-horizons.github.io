      The Past<br><p>
      This is how it will begin, based on actual conversations with the elders of the families.
      As documents begin to surface from different sources, I will compile data from sources obtained from different Personal files. My mother's  estate is a "gold mine". Next come the various "family trees" that I'm still trying digest as I have begin to construct my own. Family archives are available but some are inconsistant with the facts that I have gathered to date.
